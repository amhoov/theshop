										<h2><a href="#">Creating The Workshop</a></h2>
									</header>

									<p class="smaller">The primary function of The Workshop was to be a space that enables students to continue making after the main shop closes. However, it was in a state of disarray.
										There was a perpetuated culture of lack of respect for the space: machines were not cleaned, benchtops were left cluttered with tools and scrap metal, and tools were
										taken and not returned. These behaviors were enabled by the community view that the space was considered separate and distinct from the main shop, and thus did not .
										This divide between the “main” and “mini” shops was primarily a result of the lack of formal ownership of the mini-shop by any member of the shop staff.</p>

									<a href="toolorg.html" class="image fit"><img src="images/tools.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p class="smaller">A common problem faced by users of the shop is not being able to find the necessary tool when one needs it.
										Tools can be distributed throughout the space, thrown haphazardly in drawers, or sometimes "borrowed" indefinitely. This means that
										sometimes one spends more time looking for the right tool than actually using it. This can lead to people either misusing tools
										that they can quickly find or getting frustrated with the state of the shop. We would also like to encourage users of the shop
										to put tools back where they belong as they finish using them and discourage them from leaving tools out for extended periods of time.
									</p>
									<p class="smaller">Tools should be as easy to return as they are to find.</p>

									<a href="training.html" class="image fit"><img src="images/training0_big.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p class="smaller">We’re trying to make machine training more accessible to everyone by rethinking the training process a student interested in
									using The Shop would need to go through. The current process is inconsistent and intimidating from the perspective of the time
									committment required for some machines. We aim to create a more open, inviting, and standardized process that minimizes the barriers
								  to go from expressing interest to being able to make artifacts for projects of any kind.</p>

										<h2><a href="advwood.html">The advanced woodshop</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="advwood.html" class="image fit"><img src="images/advwood.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p class="smaller">Presently our fabrication spaces and equipment are very strong in metal, and rapid
										prototyping resources (laser cutting, 3D printing, etc.). However, our woodworking
										capabilities are very limited due to space constraints. This is a significant area of
										opportunity that The Shop is striving to take advantage of as a part of its ongoing
										improvement process. Adding woodworking capabilities would not only enhance the
										functionality of The Shop but also attract new members to The Shop community at Olin.
									</p>

									<!-- <p class="smaller">Wood is a natural entry point to making which is cheaper and also less intimidating
											than metal working. We believe that creating an advanced woodworking space for the
											community will empower more of the community to engage with The Shop and also satisfy
											the needs of our students who already have a strong interest in woodworking. An
											advanced woodshop would fulfill a specific community need that the current facilities
											cannot.
