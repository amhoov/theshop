									<h1>Tool Organization</h1>
									<div class="button">The Brief</div>
								</header>
								<h4>Opportunities and Pain Points</h4>

								<p>A common problem faced by the users of The Shop is not being able to find the
								necessary tool when one needs it. This means that sometimes one spends more
								time looking for the right tool than actually using it. This can lead to people
								either misusing tools that they can readily find or getting frustrated with the
								current state of The Shop. We would also like to encourage users of The Shop to
								put tools back where they belong and as they finish using them and discourage
								them from leaving tools out for extended periods of time. Tools should be as
								easy to return as they are to find.</p>

								<p>The greatest impact of effective tool organization and display will be in The Workshop.
								The Workshop contains almost all of the same hand tools that would be found in the other
								shops. A prototype tool organization system in The Workshop will serve as a scale testing
								platform for the rest of the shop.</p>

								<h4>Goals &amp; Objectives</h4>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>Make it easier for users to see what tools are there and missing
										<li>Shorten the process of tool storage and maintenance
										<li>Create a system of tool organization to be used in different rooms that can be scaled appropriately
										<li>Be adaptable enough to easily expand and replace tools
										<li>Make it easy to find tools quickly - no digging for tools
										<li>Educate people on the names of the tools
									</ul>
								</p>

								<h4>Tensions and Interactions</h4>
								<p> An impediment for the completion of this project is the lack of the vertical space inside of the
								shops. Statically mounting tools onto the wall might involve removing the whiteboards around the shop.</p>

								<p>Tool loss from student use is one of the primary causes of the pain points listed above. Students
								tend to take tools from The Workshop for use in the Large Project Building or other classrooms in the
								Academic Center and then leave them in their workspace. To mitigate this problem a vibrantly colored
								tape will be added to the tools. This allows us to know which tools are from the shop and need to be
								returned. We also intend for the colored tape scheme to act as a mild deterrent discouraging people
								from taking tools out of the shop.</p>

								<h4>Metrics for Success</h4>
								<p>Talking to students at the end of the semester about their experience before and after the tool
								reorganization will allow insight into how the project has affected their experience of getting and
								using tools in the shop. Additionally, cataloging how many tools have been lost over the semester
								would give us an idea of how well our tool loss prevention methods have worked.</p>
