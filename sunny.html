								<p><h2>The Spark (based on a true story)</h2><p>
								<p>	It was a mess. A complete and utter disaster. I cringed at the myriad of tools strewn aimlessly
									across the table, at the sprinkling of aluminum and steel dust that coated virtually every surface.
									I pushed through my distaste and began to do the work I came to do. As my buddy and I punched and
									bent our sheet metal brackets, another person came in and began to cut some aluminum on the horizontal
									band saw. The saw whirred rhythmically for a few minutes and promptly shut off as the stock fell to the ground.
									The next thing I heard was the brisk walk of a hurried engineering student and the familiar metallic thump of the door closing.</p>

								<p>I promptly turned around and focused in on the considerable pile of aluminum shavings that covered the
									saw and ground. I was extremely annoyed; annoyed that someone could leave such a mess without a second
									thought, annoyed that this was a space where people felt that this kind of behavior was admissible. I
									made a split second decision and raced to the door. I called the person’s name and asked them to come
									back and clean up their mess. They stared at me for a moment and reluctantly returned to tidy the machine
									they had used. It was this moment that I knew that I wanted to do something about the blatant disregard
									for the space that plagued the school. </p>

								<p><h2>What I learned from The Workshop</h2><p>
								<p>While I could certainly write about what my hopes and dreams for The Workshop are, I feel that those thoughts
									are well laid out in our summer notes and design briefs. Instead, I would like to discuss what I
									learned along the way. Thanks to The Workshop for teaching me all these lessons that are pertinent to so much more.</p>

								<h3>How do we start?</h3>
								<p>Good question. For better or worse, the universe granted me a partner in crime who shared my contempt for the way
									students treated The Workshop: Steven (	&#10084; you Steven). When beginning our journey to transform the space, we did
									lots of deep thinking into how we could physically modify the space in a way that could alter people’s perception,
									and thus their treatment, of the space. This brings us to the first lesson I learned this summer:
								</p>

								<p><blockquote align="center">So much thinking, more thinking tomorrow.</blockquote></p>

								<p>If you want to make a change, whether it be big or small, it is necessary to know why you want to
									make the change and what goals the result should accomplish. Without synthesizing the answers to
									these questions, the change has no purpose. But often, breaking down these initial ideas takes time
									and a great deal of thinking. It may feel like you are going nowhere, but push through and the
									resulting work you do will feel much more purposeful and fulfilling.</p>

								<h3>A throwback</h3>
								<p>When making a change that impacts others, it is important that you gather data that confirms (or denies)
									any assumptions you have. This can be as simple as a survey blast, which is what we did, or as involved as
									in person interviews. Sending out our survey uncovered a great deal of mystery about who uses
									The Workshop, but also uncovered a lesson that I previously learned in my first year entrepreneurship course,
									Products &amp; Markets:</p>

								<p><blockquote align="center">We did it, we beat Aaron</blockquote></p>

								<p>When looking at our survey results, we realized that we had received a similar number of responses as
									Aaron had in a previous shop survey. We immediately had the urge to “beat” him by gathering more responses
									than he had. This kind of friendly competition, where both parties benefit from a win, can help to motivate
									one or both parties to go beyond what they would have ordinarily settled for.</p>

								<h3>All the feedback</h3>
								<p>Similar to data, feedback is crucial to making something more conducive to being used by others. I
									guarantee that by having other people interact with your design, either you or they will come up with
									some way to improve it, which brights us to the next lesson:</p>

								<p><blockquote align="center">Play testing saves so much time</blockquote></p>

								<span class="image left"><img src="images/rosy_feedback.jpg" alt="" /></span><p>If you never really flesh out a design until someone else plays with it, it’s a waste of time to make
									the final version until you get some preliminary feedback. If you make a full version of your design
									every time you change a small element, you would waste so much time. So make sketch models, iterate
									on your design, and then make a final product.</p>
								<br><br>
								<h3>The Internet is Your Friend</h3>
								<p>Steven and I had been trying to figure out the tool shadow software for hours. We had been taking
									pictures of tools in different lighting conditions in an effort to get a crisp outline. This
									method was not getting us anywhere, so we accepted defeat and turned to the great expanse that is
									the internet. Of course, within five minutes, we had the answer: we needed a lightbox.</p>

								<p><blockquote align="center">Woah, they have a vacuum organizer</blockquote></p>

								<p>While the above statement seems to be completely unrelated to my initial example, it is actually
									exactly the same. I had begun designing a vacuum organizer, and when we visited Yale a few days later,
									I saw that they had the same vacuum as us, but with a off the shelf organizer. I was appalled,
									but then realized that I had never searched the internet for these organizers. In both of these
									cases, doing a quick search on the internet prior to beginning the project would have saved a
									significant amount of time. </p>

								<h3>Stay focused</h3>
								<p>When we were in the thick of redoing the The Workshop, we had a laundry list of tasks to complete.
									We started a few tasks, but kept on getting to a point where we felt that finishing the task
									would be more effort than we felt like giving at that particular moment. So, we moved on to the
									next task and the same thing happened. By the end of the day, we hadn’t finished a single task,
									and felt completely unfulfilled.</p>

								<p><blockquote align="center">Many halves don’t make a whole</blockquote></p>

								<p>Half-finishing a bunch of tasks is never as good and completely finishing a few. Honestly,
									it feels terrible to have that many tasks looming over you, just wanting to be finished.
									Additionally, while you have done so much work, it feels like you have barely done anything
									because you haven’t been able to definitively check anything off. </p>

								<h3>Two sets of eyes are better than one</h3>
								<p>We were about to move the Roland from Lawrence’s lab to The Workshop, so we asked Evan and
									Jayce to help us carry the Roland and flip the table through the door. They walked into the
									lab and immediately noticed the giant unused door that lead out of it and into the design
									studio, hence:</p>

								<p><blockquote align="center">A door unused often goes unseen</blockquote></p>

								<p>While in this case this statement is meant literally, it is also meant to remind you
									that you may not see a certain solution because you have always approached a problem a
									certain way, but a fresh set of eyes could see a better way. Additionally, don’t stop
									looking around because you think you have found a solution; always keep looking around.</p>
