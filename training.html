									<h1>Reimagining Training</h1>
								</header>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/training4_big.jpg" alt="" /></div>

								<h3>Opportunities and Pain Points</h3>
								<p>Students' understanding of the training process and purpose is currently unclear.
								Training procedures can vary for different pieces of equipment. In some cases,
							  there is a pre-reading and a quiz; for others, no preparation is required. Some trainings
								involve multiple sessions and a prescribed test part; others are short and do
								not require the fabrication of a final test artifact. The purpose of training
								is not always clear. Is it learning? Demonstrating competence? Effectively limiting
								access? Finally, students sometimes have a hard time learning about what's available
								to them in The Shop and how they can get trained to use whatever resources they
								need to complete a project.</p>

								<p>The greatest impacts of a successfully revised training system will be more
								student activity in the space, a strengthened culture of safety, and improved project
							  outcomes for course, personal, and student club projects.</p>

								<h3>Goals</h3>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Develop a continuous improvement mindset - </strong>An improved training process
											should help students to develop a mindset of continuous improvement. We want students to
											and embrace the fact that training is not a process that ends. Being &ldquol;trained&rdquo;
											is a certification that a student can safely operate a machine, but training is a
											continuous and ongoing learning process.
										<li><strong>Minimize barriers - </strong>The training process should minimize barriers to
											getting started. Every checkpoint, deliverable, or test should come with a strong justification
											for how it improves the learning process or training outcome.
										<li><strong>Build confidence - </strong>We want users of the The Shop to walk away
											from a training experience feeling more confident in their abilities rather than scared
											or with a message reinforcing a self-perception that they &ldquo;don't belong.&rdquo;
										<li><strong>Increase transparency - </strong>The training system should be transparent. I should
											be obvious how one gets training and what kind of committment training on each piece of equipment
											requires.
										<li><strong>Be exciting and welcoming - </strong>The process of training should be exciting
											for the user. They should be able to see a path to completing a project that they're
											passionate about. We would like training to open up a world of possibility and show them
											how powerful turning their ideas into physical reality can be.
										<li><strong>Encourage curiosity - </strong>Training is just the first glimpse into what is possible.
											Students should be encouraged to ask questions throughout the process and (especially) afterward.
										</ul>
								</p>

								<h3>Tensions and Challenges</h3>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Welcoming vs. accommodating demand - </strong>We want the process to be as friendly
											and welcoming as possible, but we also recognize that time is a finite resource. If we are successful
											in making the process open, transparent, and welcoming, we expect to encounter challenges meeting the
											demand from community members. This, however, is a good problem to have.
										<li><strong>Efficient production vs. learning - </strong>Often times, making something yourself is not the
											most <i>efficient</i> way to arrive at a functional artifact. Certainly, making something using a process
											on which you've only just been trained is likely to be punctuated by frequent errors. However, it's in
											the making of those mistakes that the learning is most powerful. Our training approaches and supporting
											processes will need to strike a delicate balance between facilitating learning (and the attendant
											making of mistakes) and enabling efficient production of artifacts.
										<li><strong>Building confidence vs. overconfidence - </strong>We want students to walk away from a training
											experience feeling more confident in their abilities. However, we need to be careful to impress upon them
											the importance of basic safety practices like wearing personal protective equipment, properly handling
											and securing their workpieces, and asking questions when they don't know how to do something. This tension goes
											hand-in-hand with our goal of developing lifelong learners who adopt a continuous improvement mindset.

								<h3>Metrics for Success</h3>
								<p>One very simple and straightforward metric of success will be the number of successfully completed trainings
								in a given semester or year. (It is probably preferable to use a full year to avoid seasonal variation due to course
								or project team schedules.) Another way to measure success might be comparing the number of aborted trainings
							  in years past to the number of aborted trainings after the new system is implemented.</p>
